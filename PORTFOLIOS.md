# Portfolio Allocation Menu — by Risk Profile

Companion to `REGIMES.md`. All results: daily data 2007-06 → 2026-08 (includes 2008, 2020, 2022), dividends included, T-bill cash yield, leveraged ETFs simulated pre-2010 from QQQ (3x/2x daily reset − financing at T-bill+100bps − 0.95% ER). Metrics per the user's spec: CAGR, Sortino, max drawdown, beta (vs SPY); Sharpe added. Full grid: `research/portfolio_menu.csv`, annual returns: `research/portfolio_annual.csv`.

## Evidence quality — read first

- **Static mixes and the indices strategy are honest backtests of pre-specified rules.**
- **The "Regime" portfolios are in-sample designs**: their quadrant playbooks were chosen after seeing this sample's quadrant payoff table, so their numbers are upward-biased. Treat as upper bounds until validated on data that didn't inform the design (pre-2007, or forward paper).

## The menu

## By risk tier (banded on max drawdown)

| Tier | maxDD band | Best honest option | Regime candidate (needs validation) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | < 20% | Permanent 4×25 (+7.3%, Sortino 1.06) | Regime CONS (+7.7%, −15%, beta 0.09) |
| Moderate | 20–35% | 60/40, or Indices 1x for lower beta | Regime MOD (+13.3%, −27%) / Regime AGG (+22.4%, −32%) |
| Aggressive | 35–45% | 33 QLD/GLD/TLT (+15.3%, Sortino 1.19, −37%) | — |
| Very aggressive | > 45% | 33 TQQQ/GLD/TLT (+19.7%, −51%) or 100% QQQ | Regime VAGG (+29.8%, −51%) |

## Findings

1. **The 33/33/33 TQQQ/GLD/TLT mix the user read about is real but mislabeled as balanced**: +19.7% CAGR and Sortino 1.13, but −51% max drawdown and beta ≈ 1.0. Its failure mode is precisely a regime event: **2022 (−41.9%)**, when inflation broke the bond leg at the same time the levered equity leg fell — the two "ballasts" and the engine all sank together. 2008 was −34%.
2. **The QLD (2x) version dominates it risk-adjusted**: Sortino 1.19 vs 1.13, −37% vs −51% DD, at +15.3% CAGR — a better default for the same idea.
3. **Static leveraged mixes vs the indices strategy**: the 33/33 mixes earn their return from *diversified always-on leverage*; the indices strategy earns it from *timing*. Their drawdown profiles are complementary (mixes die in inflation years like 2022 [−42%] which the trend strategy sidestepped [−5%]; the trend strategy bleeds in chop like 2015-16 which the mixes shrugged off). Combining them is the obvious next test.
4. **Regime portfolios post the best headline numbers** (AGG: +22.4%, Sortino 1.11, −32%, Sharpe 0.95) but carry the design bias flag; their honest validation is forward paper trading or a pre-2007 replication with different-era ETF proxies.
5. Every leveraged-ETF result relies on the daily-reset simulation assumptions; real TQQQ tracking since 2010 is close to this model, but pre-2010 numbers are model, not history.
